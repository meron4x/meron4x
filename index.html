            <p class="pag">Hey, you know this is my homepage, so I have to say something about myself. Sometimes it is hard to introduce yourself because you know yourself so well that you do not know where to start with. Let me give a try to see what kind of image you have about me through my self-description. I hope that my impression about myself and your impression about me are not so different.<br> Here it goes. <br>

                I am a person who is positive about every aspect of life. There are many things I like to do, to see, and to experience. I like to read, I like to write, I like to think, I like to dream, I like to talk, I like to listen. I like to see the sunrise in the morning, I like to see the moonlight at night, I like to feel the music flowing on my face, I like to smell the wind coming from the ocean, I like to look at the clouds in the sky with a blank mind, I like to do thought experiment when I can not sleep in the middle of the night. I like flowers in spring, rain in summer, leaves in autumn, and snow in winter. I like to sleep early, I like to get up late, I like to be alone, I like to be surrounded by people, I like country’s peace, because i have got something to relate, i like computers and softwares, i like the fact that technology can make life a little easier, I like delicious food and comfortable shoes, I like good books and good music, I like the land and the nature, I like people. And, I like to laugh.

                I like looking up to great people like Elon Musk and so many entrepreneurs. I like business and I love computer science. The art of making things work and available so that someone can use it gives me a good feeling. I also like great psychologists, like William James or Sigmund Freud, who could read people’s mind. Of course, I am nowhere close to these people, yet. I am just someone who does some teaching, some research, programming and a hard work. But my dream is still alive.</p>
